//! Visual constants.
//!
//! Colours are literal sRGB values written straight into the vertex stream;
//! the swapchain is UNORM, so no transfer curve is applied on the way out.
//!
//! Metrics are logical units at ninety six dpi. Every consumer multiplies
//! them by the interface scale and rounds, which keeps one pixel borders
//! exactly one pixel wide at any display factor.
//!
//! The structure also carries the style switches the drawing pass consults.
//! Copying them out of the configuration once per frame keeps the draw code
//! free of a dependency on the settings tree, which is owned by the
//! application and is not available while the widget tree is being drawn.

//! Widget system.
//!
//! The interface is declared every frame into a node arena, solved by the
//! flexbox engine and then drawn. State that cannot be derived from the
//! declaration, such as which control has focus, whether a group is folded, how
//! far a list is scrolled or where a slider was grabbed, lives in a retained map
//! keyed by widget identity.
//!
//! Hit testing uses the rectangle a widget occupied on the previous frame.
//! The alternative, solving the layout before interaction, would need two
//! layout passes per frame for no visible gain: a rectangle only changes when
//! the window is resized, and one frame of lag on a click is not perceptible.
//! The column widths are carried across frames for the same reason and with
//! the same justification.
//!
//! Identity is a hash of the widget key mixed with the enclosing scope, so the
//! same key may appear in several panels without colliding. The key is a stable
//! identifier and never the displayed text: were the two the same, changing
//! language would reset focus, folding and scroll position across the interface.
//!
//! Two things are drawn outside the tree because the layout model has no
//! absolute positioning: the open combo list and the diagnostic overlay. Both
//! are anchored to a rectangle that is already known when they are drawn.
//!
//! ## Width the wording needs
//!
//! Nothing in the layout model can grow a fixed width container to fit its
//! content, and the side panel is exactly that: its width is an operator
//! decision carried across sessions. So the panel is measured instead. Every
//! labelled row records the width of its caption and of its numeric readout,
//! and the widest row of the frame is published as a demand the application
//! uses as the floor of the panel width.
//!
//! That is the only arrangement that survives a translation. A ceiling stated
//! in logical units is a bet on one wording, and the wording is what changes.
